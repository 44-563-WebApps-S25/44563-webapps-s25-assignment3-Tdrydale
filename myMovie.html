            My favorite movie has to be step brothers, Me and my family use to watch it all the time when i was younger. 
            It was the perfect humor for my age at the time first watching it, now it has a more so sentimental factor to it instead of it being funny. 
            For my senior year in high school me and my cousin recreated a scene in the movie for our film study class.
